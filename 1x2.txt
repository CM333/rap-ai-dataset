Opponent A: Adolf Hitler
Opponent B: Darth Vader
Swearing is allowed.

Adolf Hitler:

I am Adolf Hitler: Commander of the Third Reich!

Little known fact: also dope on the mic!

You are Vader, with your little boots and cape,

And helmet to cover up that burnt-ass face!

You have the force to move objects; I am a force truly evil!

Even went back in time and turned you whack in the prequel,

'Cause look at you! You're not even a real person!

I preferred you in Spaceballs: the Rick Moranis version!

Darth Vader:

You can't rhyme against the dark side of the Force! Why even bother?

So many dudes been with your mom, who even knows if I'm your father?

You're a pissed off little prick with a Napoleon dick!

You call that a mustache? I call that Dirty Sanchez on your lip!

You bitch, let me remind you who you're messing with!

Everything that you did, I'm the mother fucker who invented it!

I'm the original Dark Lord; you're like the sorcerer's apprentice!

My Stormtroopers make yours look like someone took a piece of shit and cloned it!

Adolf Hitler:

You stink, Vader; your style smells something sour.

You need to wash up, dawg; here, step in my shower!

I'll turn all your friends against you; just my speeches breed haters!

What’s your lightsaber VS a clan of all your white neighbors?

Darth Vader:

Suck my robot balls!

Now, take a step back and let me freeze yours off!

A little carbonite bath for your goose stepping ass!

We'll call my homeboy in Israel; see who got the last laugh!
