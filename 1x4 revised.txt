Opponent A: Albert Einstein
Opponent B: Stephen Hawking
Swearing is not allowed.

Albert Einstein:

When I apply my battle theory, minds are relatively blown,

So take a seat, Steve. Oop! I see you brought your own.

What's with your voice? I can't frickin' tell!

You sound like WALL-E having sex with a Speak & Spell!

I'll school you anywhere: MIT to Oxford!

All your fans will be like, "Um, that was Hawk-ward!"

I'm as dope as two rappers! You better be scared,

'Cause that means Albert E equals MC squared!

Stephen Hawking:

You've got no idea what you're messin' with here, boy!

I got 12-inch rims on my chair. That's how I roll, y'all!

You look like someone glued a mustache on a troll doll!

I'll be stretching out the rhyme, like gravity stretches time,

When you try to put your little p-brane against this kind of mind!

I’m the best! I'm the Snoop Dogg of science!

I'll be dropping mad apples on your head from the shoulders of giants!

Albert Einstein:

I'm the giant whose shoulders you’d have stood on, if you could stand!

I'll give you a brief history of pain with the back of my hand!

You can't destroy matter or me, for serious!

Ripping holes in you bigger than the hole in your black hole theory was!

Stephen Hawking:

There are ten million, million, million, million, million, million, million, million, million particles in the universe that we can observe.

Your mama took the ugly ones and put them into one nerd!

You wanna bring the heat with the mushroom clouds you're making?

I'm about to bake raps from scratch like Carl Sagan!

And while it's true that my work is based on you,

I'm a super computer. You’re like a TI-82! Ooh!
