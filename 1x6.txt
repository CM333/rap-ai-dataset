Opponent A: Thomas Edison
Opponent B: Nikola Tesla
Swearing is not allowed.

Thomas Edison:

Step up! You'll be shocked when I spit and start static!

I'll rip your style and add it to my long list of patents!

While you were busy digging ditches and burning bridges,

I'm pumping out inventions, stacking riches, so go back to your pigeons!

You're a geek; plagued by OCD!

You never had sex, but you sure got screwed by me!

I'll crush you, Tesla! There's just no putting it gently!

I don't alternate my flow; I diss you directly!

Nikola Tesla:

I see a universe of infinite energy,

But no potential for threat from this enemy!

So you can call me Tesla, Nikola, impeccably dressed!

Giving lessons in electrical nemesis; this will be on the test!

So confess to your thefts, and let the whole world know

What the Serbian did for the Wizard of Menlo!

History is getting rewritten, and I have reddit.

Your best invention was a way to steal credit.

Thomas Edison:

The truth hertz; you're broke and washed up!

Don't give a smidgen 'bout your visions if they can't make a buck!

I conduct business; understood things you never could!

So dope that I even make New Jersey look good!

I'm on the record I invented. You got duped; there, I said it,

And I'll bet you 50 thousand dollars that you'll never forget it!

Without me, here's a taste of what this battle would be:

No lights, no camera, no sound. See?

Nikola Tesla:

You fool! You think that you can touch me with this?

You couldn't handle my gifts with your greedy little mind.

What's inside mine was ahead of its own time!

You did not steal from me; you stole me from mankind!

It's a wireless transmission of truth,

And it's a shocking real story of a banker and you,

And if the people knew you stopped me from making power free,

They would curse the con Edison with every utility!
